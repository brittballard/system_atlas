# Cucumber features

RSpec is specified using both RSpec and
[Cucumber](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber). Cucumber provides
_executable documentation_.  This means that the _.feature_ files below this
directory serve as specification, documentation _and_ regression tests of the
behaviour.

## Issues

If you find this documentation incomplete or confusing, please [submit an
issue](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues).
